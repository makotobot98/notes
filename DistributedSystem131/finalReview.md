### R suggestions
- put "Experience" section in front of "Project" (ur Experience looks more practical and advance in comparing to Project)
#### for project session
- try to have each bullet is illustrating an accomplishments with related stack technologies
  > so in **Daily Zot** first bullet, "Built a single-page app that keeps track of (un)completed tasks and display them in
weekly/monthly report to help students stay productive during COVID-19 lockdown" is too long in explaining what it does but missing the backend/frontend stacks of it
- add some testing experiences will be great, look into `Sinon.js`, `mocha.js`. For integration tests, look into `cucumber`. Those are very helpful and easy to learn.
#### for activity session
- adding details for **aggregating resources**. (e.g., do you cache the aggregated results? or does every request will invoke three http requests into Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube)
