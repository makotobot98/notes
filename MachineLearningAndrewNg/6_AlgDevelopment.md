- plotting training/cross validation/test errors
  - relationship between overfiting and underfitting with the plots
  - how does change of lambda, # feature, # of training example might improve the algorithm
  - how to based on the graph, decide those trade offs

- error analysis

- precision/recall
  - graph, trade offs
  - false/positives
  - F1 score for automatic choosing a proper thresh hold for precision/recall
