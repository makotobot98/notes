- Why are neural network better for multi-class classification algorithm? in what way?
- for architecturing, how is picking more hidden layers and units in different layer will affect the model?




# Handwriting Recognition
- gradient check to debug back propagation
- random initialization to break symmetry
- iterating to pick the right lambda for regularization and avoid overfitting/underfitting
