# Supervised learning
- we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.
- Supervised learning problems are categorized into **regression** and **classification** problems

# Unsupervised Learning
- We can derive structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables; We can derive this structure by clustering the data based on relationships among the variables in the data.


# Notations
m = Number of training examples

x = 'input' variable / features

y = 'output' variable / target variable

(x, y) = one training example

(x^(i), y^(i)) = ith training example

h: hypothesis to predict y's given x's
